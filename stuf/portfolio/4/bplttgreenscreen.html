<h3>Greenscreen &ndash; The Barclays Premier League Trophy Tour</h3>
<h4>Your special moment lifting the Barclays Premier League Trophy in front of your teams home crowd </h4>
<p>I created a touchscreen app that takes a photo of a consumer and superimposes them holding the Barclays Premier League Trophy and into a stadium of their choice.</p>
<p>The app travelled around the world to 10 different countries &ndash; each country required a different language and keyboard layout (including Arabic and Chinese layouts).</p>
<p>The app allowed users to complete the process without the constant monitoring of staff</p>
<p>Over 24,000 photos were taken across the 10 events</p>
<p>Over 11,000 users visited the microsite to download their phot</p>
<p>Users then could share the photo with friends on facebook and by email</p>
