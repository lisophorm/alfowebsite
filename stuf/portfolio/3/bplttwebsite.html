<h3>Barclays Premier League Trophy Tour</h3>
<h4>Creating a bespoke online solution to cater for international Pre and Post event communications Website</h4>
<p>To go along side the Barclays Premier League Trophy Tour we created a website to support the pre and post campaign consumer interaction.</p>
<p>The website hosted a section for visitors to learn about the tour and its locations as well as reserve a time to visit the event.</p>
<p>After the event visitors could log-in using their event wristband and retrieve their greenscreen trophy photo &ndash; at this point we collected a range of data.</p>
<p>The website was built in relevant local languages including Chinese and Arabic</p>
<p>Over 24,000 visitors booked a timeslot for an event</p>
<p>More than 11,000 returned to the website to get their greenscreen photo</p>
<p>Overall the website was visited over 100,000 times</p>
