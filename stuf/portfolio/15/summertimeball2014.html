<h3>Vodafone Summertime Ball 2014</h3>
<h4>Drive momentum and engagement of the Vodafone Firsts campaign</h4>
<p>I designed a &quot;Find Your First&quot; that was mimicking the campaign brief. This app allowed participants to find what type of &quot;First&quot; matched their personality.  </p>
<p>The app worked by asking the participant a series of questions that gave insight into their personality and interests. 
  Once this was identified, the app proposed three potential Firsts, one of which was selected by the participant. 
  Afterwards, they were encouraged to pull a facial expression as if they'd just achieved their First as their photo was taken via a built in camera. 
  Photos were shared directly to Facebook or sent out via email.</p>
<p>The results: <strong>400 participans</strong> shared their activity on Facebook, and created an <strong>active conversation with over 15.000 FB users</strong>.</p>
