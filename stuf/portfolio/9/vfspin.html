<h3>MMS Mechanics - Vodafone Spin &amp; Win</h3>
<h4>Supporting the Vodafone new store openings across UK MMS Mechanics - Vodafone Spin &amp; Win</h4>
<p><strong>THE BRIEF:</strong> To modify three giant in-store BlackBerry handsets, incorporating a touch-screen interface to support the Vodafone New Store Opening activity across the UK.</p>
<p><strong>THE EXPERIENCE</strong>: Vodafone customers were given the opportunity to send an MMS photo of their face to a short code &ndash; on arrival in-store, customer photos were already uploaded and displayed on the &lsquo;roulette wheel&rsquo; onscreen. Customers could then spin the &lsquo;roulette wheel&rsquo; and if it stopped on their photo they would instantly win a prize from the UEFA Champions League prize pool.</p>
<p><strong>THE RESULT:</strong> Between November 2008 and February 2009, the campaign was launched in 18 stores over eight weekends and realised a 62% redemption rate from entrants to the game played instore.</p>
