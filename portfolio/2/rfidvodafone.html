<p dir="ltr"> - As part of an F1 fan zone in Budapest, I used RFID technology to amplify the on site activity by enabling visitors to automatically <strong>share their event experience with their friends on Facebook</strong>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">6 stations around the event had RFID enabled points where <strong>users could have a go on the assets and post their scores to their Facebook wall</strong>. The station that created more interest (over 30% of total interactions) was based on a<strong> green screen photo-mechanic</strong>: the consumer could sit into a real f1 car andsuper-imposed to a F1 track.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Users could register at any station or could swipe their RFID wristband to <strong>automatically bring up their details</strong>.</p>
The system led to over <strong>5,000 on-site</strong> consumer registrations which generated <strong>300,000 Facebook unique impressions</strong>. The  Facebook amplification <strong>continued post event for three days</strong> with other 46,000 impressions.
