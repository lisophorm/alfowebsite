<h3>RFID and Facebook Connect &ndash; Vodafone Car Run, Budapest 2012</h3>
<h4 dir="ltr">Use of RFID wristbands to maximise the amplification on social media of a live promotion.</h4>
<p dir="ltr">As part of an F1 fan zone in Budapest, I used RFID technology to amplify the on site activity by enabling visitors to automatically share their event experience with their friends on Facebook.</p>
<p dir="ltr">6 stations around the event had RFID enabled points where users could have a go on the assets and post their scores to their Facebook wall.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Users could register at any station or could swipe their RFID wristband to automatically bring up their details</p>
The system led to over 5,000 on-site consumer registrations which generated 300,000 Facebook impressions
