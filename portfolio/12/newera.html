<body><h3>Photobooth â€“ MLB Dugout, New Era Store</h3><h4>Creating an authentic MLB Baseball Card and uploading it straight to Facebook</h4><p>As part of creating an &lsquo;MLB Dugout&rsquo; in the New Era Store for 2 weeks, we built a photobooth app that took a picture of consumers and turned them into their own baseball card, users could then upload their personalised cards to Facebook.</p>
<p>The app allowed the user to select a position and a nickname that appeared on the overlay.</p>
<p>From just over 100 photos uploaded to Facebook, we generated 294 likes for MLB and 21,312 Facebook impressions.</p>
