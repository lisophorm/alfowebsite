<body><h3>Facebook check-in â€“ Intel Ultrabook Lounge, Festivals 2012</h3><h4>Transforming 1,000s of on-site event check-ins into millions of Facebook impressions</h4><p>To show off the new Intel Ultrabooks we created an app that entered consumers at festivals into an hourly competition to win an Ultrabook laptop</p>
<p>The apps were installed on laptops fixed to the stand as well as staff roaming laptops</p>
<p>To enter the users had to login to Facebook via the app that checked them into the &lsquo;Intel Ultrabook Lounge&rsquo; and posted a message on their Facebook wall</p>
<p>Once an hour a live draw took place when a large screen counted down to 0 and announced a winner bringing in crowds of hopeful spectators</p>
<p>The app created 2,161,534 unique impressions from 7,088 Facebook registrations</p>
<p>The wall posts generated 2,759 click-throughs to a retail landing page across 3 events - 38% of actual Facebook registrations</p>
