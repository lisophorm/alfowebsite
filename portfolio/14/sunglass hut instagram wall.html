<h3>Sunglass Hut - Instagram Wall</h3>
<h4>Taking an Instagram feed relating to the brand and displaying the photos in a dynamic way within the event space </h4>
<p>The instagram wall has been used at two events for Sunglasses Hut and throughout the duration of the event the public were encouraged to post photos using instagram &ndash; by doing so they were entered into a competition. </p>
<p>When photos with the hashtag #styleitout were posted they would be collected and composed on the instagram wall on site.  The screen would hold the most recent photos and make space by removing the oldest. </p>
<p>A moderation tool is also provided and there is the option of holding all posts or taking photos down should any be inappropriate  </p>
<p>Throughout these events we had 310 photos uploaded to the wall via the #.  </p>
<p>The instagram wall provides encouraging, digital and aesthetic value to the event space.  </p>
