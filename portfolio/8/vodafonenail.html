<h3>Vodafone London Fashion Week </h3>
<h4>Celebrating London Fashion Week and Vodafone London Fashion weekend with a unique nail polish vending machine</h4>
<p>To celebrate London Fashion Week and Vodafone London Fashion Weekend, I have been requested by Vodafone UK to come with a concept for unique nail polish vending machine.</p><p>Instead of using money, the customer “pays” sharing on social media his/her engagement with Vodafone.</p><p>I’ve built the registration / social media software with a rugged touchscreen PC. And working closely with a vending machine company I interfaced it with the delivery mechanism.</p>
