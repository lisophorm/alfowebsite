<h3>Sky Sports Test Lab</h3>
<h4>Create a high tech activation to support the latest Sky Tv promotions</h4>
<p>As a part of the Sky Sports TV promotion I designed an experiential competition: the customer with the highest score will a Sky Package.</p>
<p>The competition was based on on trivia quiz and 2 skill games.</p>
<p>The quiz was on a large touchscreen and I used Surface Tablets registration and capturing scores.</p>
<p>For the registration I used fingerprint scanners. This way the customer can be recognized at each data entry point just with the touch of a finger </p>
<p>A real time leaderboard was displaying the highest scores.</p>
<p>At the end of each day every customer received a tailored email with the scores.</p>
<p>The promotion was happening simultaneously in several shopping centres across UK.</p>
<p>Real time intelligence data was provided to EM / Client to maximize the promotion</p>
