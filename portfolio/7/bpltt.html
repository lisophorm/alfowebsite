<h3> Barclays Premier League Trophy Tour </h3>
<h4>Activating the largest football sponsorship in the world in nine global markets</h4>
<p>The Barclays Premier League is the most watched league in the world; however, analysis of research showed that the majority of worldwide fans only have a brand relationship through their TV&rsquo;s. </p>
<p>In order to deliver against the insight, we created the ultimate brand experience journey and toured it around the world.</p>
<p>The experience includes; an interactive museum, immersive projection sequence, intimate trophy moment and the ultimate memento, a photo of the visitor holding aloft the Premiership trophy (click here for case study).</p>
<p>The whole customer journey was tied together by state of the art fingerprint scanners.</p>
<p>The user could register at any interaction point or could just bring up their details swiping their finger.</p>
<p>To date the experience has engaged with over 46,000 loyal fans, with 96% of visitors rating the experience good to excellent (exit poll survey) and generating over 2m of estimated media value.</p>
